# is-internet-up-bash
## A Bash script to test connectivity until internet becomes available again and notify you

I have a old macbook that I use as a displayserver next to me, which is why I specificly did the command "say" (Which basically use TTS to say when the internet is up).

This you can change to anything, so just change "say 'the internet is up..'" to "echo 'Internet is up'" to just have it display text instead of MacOs tts.

## Why ssl handshake connectivity?
Because checking connection via ping is inferior.. and I had time. :) 

## How does it sound like?
